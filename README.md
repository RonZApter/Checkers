Hello, and welcome to my project: Checkers with Q-Learning.
The project is currently a work in progress â€” it's still running in the terminal (not yet using Windows Forms), there are a few known bugs, and the AI implementation is not yet fully refined.

That being said, the core algorithm is already functioning, and you're welcome to try playing a game of checkers with it!

To make a move, please specify the coordinates in the following format:
  Enter starting index:
  a6
  Enter destination index:
  b5
